# SeafloorMapper
A Python GUI Application for seafloor mapping from ICESat-2.

This is developed by using PyQt6, and works on Windows 7/8/10/11.

The application provides a full workflow for automatic seafloor mapping by using a PointNet++ model, and also enables manual seafloor mapping for creating the training data for the model or simply creating the seafloor data without using automated methods.
