# SeafloorMapper
A Python GUI Application for seafloor mapping from ICESat-2.

This is developed by using PyQt6, and works on Windows 7/8/10/11.

The application provides a full workflow for automatic seafloor mapping by using a PointNet++ model, and also enables manual seafloor mapping for creating the training data for the model or simply creating the seafloor data without using automated methods.

Please find the installer files from the release https://github.com/ylin152/SeafloorMapper/releases/tag/v1.0.
